# Cpp-Projects

This is nothing special, just a collection of most  of the C++ projects I've done...


About Week 5 Projects:
These C++ code files are various techniques demonstrating memory simulation. It shows how to take 10 different objects, with verious values, being the same of different, and comparing those values with other established values by iterating through a vector. The main difference between each technique, is the logic behind the memory allocation function(int mem_allocation()), which uses a for loop and if else statements.
